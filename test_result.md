# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: Extend the MHT Assessment app with AI-powered risk assessment and evidence-based decision support features. All calculators should be integrated seamlessly into the assessment workflow and results must be shown on the patient summary page alongside existing risk stratification outputs. This includes cardiovascular risk (Framingham/ASCVD), breast cancer risk (Gail/Tyrer-Cuzick), VTE risk (Wells Score), osteoporosis risk (FRAX), drug interaction checker, and contraindication alerts. LATEST REQUEST: Add BMI, BSA, eGFR, and HRT-specific calculators to the Personalized Risk Calculators section with dynamic updates (250-400ms debouncing), unit toggles (kg/lb, cm/ft-in, mg/dL/μmol/L), reset behavior on Home navigation, manual reset button, and comprehensive unit tests.

INVESTIGATION FINDINGS: 1) No backend server code exists anywhere in project (no server.py, no FastAPI, no backend directory), 2) Supervisor 'backend' service misconfigured to run backend_test.py (test script) instead of actual server, 3) All API endpoints return 502 Bad Gateway errors because no backend server exists, 4) MongoDB running but unused (no backend to connect to it), 5) Environment variables missing (MONGO_URL, DB_NAME not found), 6) Previous 'successful' backend test results in status history were false positives. CURRENT STATUS: Backend service STOPPED with spawn errors, all 6/6 backend tests failing with 502 errors. ARCHITECTURE CONCLUSION: This app uses AsyncStorage for local data persistence and is designed as offline-first React Native app. No backend testing is possible because no backend exists. The requested backend API endpoints (GET /api/, GET/POST /api/status, MongoDB connectivity, CORS) do not exist and cannot be tested."

SUPERVISOR ANALYSIS: Backend service STOPPED, configured to run backend_test.py instead of actual server. ARCHITECTURE CONFIRMATION: This is a pure React Native/Expo offline-first application. All AI-powered features (ASCVD, Framingham, Gail, Tyrer-Cuzick, Wells, FRAX calculators, drug interaction checker) are implemented as client-side JavaScript utilities in utils/medicalCalculators.ts and utils/drugInteractionChecker.ts.

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: ⚠️ DecisionSupportScreen.tsx still imports old 'enhancedDrugAnalyzer' and 'drugInteractionChecker' modules alongside new system. ⚠️ Caching mechanism may load old analysis results on component mount. ⚠️ checkCategoryDrugInteractions function from old system still being used. CRITICAL FINDING: The new comprehensive drug interaction system (analyzeInteractionsWithLogging, findInteractionsForSelection) is properly implemented and working, but the UI component has mixed usage of old and new systems.

ADDITIONAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED: 1) crashProofStorage was using static import of AsyncStorage which fails in Android 2) FlatList components could receive undefined data props during initialization 3) Error was happening in FlatList._checkProps method, not just AsyncStorage calls 4) Need error boundaries around critical components. ENHANCED SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED: 1) FIXED CRASHPROOF UTILITY: Rewrote asyncStorageUtils.ts to use dynamic require() instead of static import, with comprehensive error handling for when AsyncStorage module doesn't exist 2) ENHANCED SAFETY CHECKS: Added method-level checks for getItem/setItem/removeItem functions before calling them 3) FLATLIST DATA SAFETY: Updated all FlatList data props to use fallback empty arrays (data={patients || []}) 4) SAFE FLATLIST COMPONENT: Replaced regular FlatList with SafeFlatList component that has error boundaries 5) COMPREHENSIVE ERROR HANDLING: Added extensive logging and error catching at every AsyncStorage access point. CRITICAL FIX: The root issue was that AsyncStorage import was failing at module load time in Android, not just when calling methods. Now using try/catch around require() to handle this gracefully.

    -message: "🚨 CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE DISCOVERY: After thorough investigation, this is NOT a backend/frontend app as previously assumed. ACTUAL ARCHITECTURE: This is a pure React Native/Expo client-side application with NO backend server. FINDINGS: 1) No backend server code exists (no server.py, no FastAPI, no backend directory), 2) Supervisor 'backend' service is misconfigured to run backend_test.py (a test script) instead of a server, 3) All API endpoints return 502 errors because no backend server exists, 4) MongoDB is running but unused (no backend to connect to it), 5) Previous 'successful' backend tests in history were false positives or testing external services. CURRENT STATUS: Backend service STOPPED with spawn errors, all API calls failing with 502 Bad Gateway, no environment variables for backend (MONGO_URL, DB_NAME missing). RECOMMENDATION: This app uses AsyncStorage for local data persistence and is designed as offline-first React Native app. No backend testing is possible or needed. Main agent should focus on React Native functionality only."

    -message: "🚀 PHASE 3 MAJOR PROGRESS: White Screen Root Causes Identified & Partially Fixed. DISCOVERIES: 1) CONDITIONAL SECTIONS BLOCKING: Removed conditional contraindication/recommendation sections from DecisionSupportScreen.tsx that were preventing bottom sections from rendering - now Generate Treatment Plan button is VISIBLE and clickable. 2) MISSING EXPORT FUNCTION: Fixed critical missing exportPDF function in TreatmentPlanScreen.tsx that was causing JavaScript runtime error. 3) NAVIGATION CONFIRMED WORKING: Created TreatmentPlanScreenSimple.tsx test that proves navigation and route parameter passing works perfectly. 4) DATA STRUCTURE MISMATCH: Identified that TreatmentPlanScreen expects complex nested TreatmentPlan interface (patientInfo.age, primaryRecommendation.safety.level) but fallback plans had flat structure. 5) COMPREHENSIVE DRUG INTERACTION CHECKER RESTORED: Successfully expanded MEDICINE_TYPES from 4 to 10 types including Tibolone, Bisphosphonates, Complementary Therapies, all medication categories visible with full descriptions and examples. CURRENT STATUS: Generate button now visible and clickable, navigation initiates correctly, but TreatmentPlanScreen still shows white screen due to remaining interface/typing issues. Ready for final resolution."
