# MHT Assessment - Final APK Build Ready 🚀

## ✅ INTEGRATION COMPLETE

All MHT rules have been successfully integrated into the app with the following components:

### 🔧 Rules Engine Integration
- **TypeScript Rules Engine**: `utils/rulesEngine.ts` - Full port of decision_engine.js
- **JSON Rules**: Embedded in `assets/mht_rules/` and `android/app/src/main/assets/mht_rules/`
  - `risk_thresholds.json` - Risk categorization thresholds
  - `drug_interactions.json` - Medication interaction definitions  
  - `treatment_rules.json` - Treatment decision rules
- **Unit Tests**: All 20 test cases pass with expected outputs
- **Offline Capability**: Rules work without internet connection

### 📱 User Interface
- **New Screen**: `RulesBasedTreatmentPlanScreen.tsx` with full mobile UX
- **Navigation**: Integrated into `DecisionSupportScreen.tsx` with "Generate Rules-Based Plan" button
- **Safety Features**: Medical disclaimers, clinical alerts, contraindication warnings
- **Export Ready**: PDF export hooks prepared (can be implemented)

### 🧪 Validation Results
**First 5 Test Cases Output:**
```
--- case-1 ---
therapy_selected: estrogen_oral meds: [ 'statins' ]
Primary: Prefer non-hormonal therapies; if HRT required, use lowest effective dose, consider transdermal
Suitability: Use with caution
Rationale: High ASCVD risk increases cardiovascular events with systemic HRT; prefer non-hormonal options.
Warnings: ascvd_high

--- case-2 ---
therapy_selected: estrogen_oral meds: []
Primary: Avoid estrogen-based therapies; consider non-hormonal options and specialist referral
Suitability: Contraindicated
Rationale: High breast cancer risk — avoid estrogen exposure.
Warnings: breast_high

--- case-3 ---
therapy_selected: estrogen_transdermal meds: [ 'anticoagulants' ]
Primary: Avoid oral estrogen; consider non-hormonal or transdermal if necessary
Suitability: Contraindicated
Rationale: Recent VTE is a contraindication to systemic estrogen.

--- case-4 ---
therapy_selected: none meds: [ 'calcium' ]
Primary: Prioritize osteoporosis therapy (bisphosphonate/denosumab as appropriate) and bone protective measures
Suitability: Suitable (for osteoporosis therapy)
Rationale: High FRAX risk requires fracture prevention therapy.
Warnings: frx_high

--- case-5 ---
therapy_selected: estrogen_oral meds: [ 'anticonvulsants' ]
Primary: Interaction: reduced_estrogen_effectiveness
Suitability: Use with caution
Rationale: Medication interaction detected: anticonvulsants -> reduced_estrogen_effectiveness
Warnings: interaction_anticonvulsants_estrogen_oral, anticonvulsant_interaction
```
