The AI engineer's work spanned multiple critical areas: stabilizing the Generate Treatment Plan flow, developing a deterministic decision engine, fixing frontend preview issues, and enhancing GitHub synchronization capabilities. Initial work focused on resolving  blank screens and refactoring  to . A major bug causing blank web previews due to Metro bundler's file watcher limits (ENOSPC error) consumed significant effort, leading to multiple failed attempts,  invocation, and temporary workarounds like static HTML. Concurrently, a rule-driven treatment plan engine was developed, incorporating JSON data for contraindications and risk thresholds, and a  with a Simulate mode. The most recent efforts centered on improving the GitHub sync script for the containerized environment, addressing issues like  not being set, user-provided sensitive tokens, and repository creation conflicts, the last of which is currently being resolved.

<product_requirements>
The MHT Assessment app is an offline-first, testable, accessible, and performant React Native/Expo (SDK 50) clinical decision support tool for Menopause Hormone Therapy. It aims to display calculated risk scores, provide personalized risk calculators, offer evidence-based decision support (including drug interaction checker), and generate clinician-friendly treatment plans that can be saved and exported as PDFs. Data persistence is handled locally with encrypted SQLite or AsyncStorage. Key technical requirements include native-safe code for Android APK builds, unit/E2E testing, CME dashboard features, and self-contained Android APK generation.

Work done so far includes resolving Metro bundler issues, restoring app display, implementing comprehensive PDF export, removing extraneous UI texts/buttons, addressing platform-specific export limitations, renaming Settings to About and adding a Disclaimer screen. The primary focus of the detailed trajectory was to stabilize the Decision Support - Treatment Plan flow, which previously crashed or showed blank screens, and ensure it produces medicine-based plans with interaction checks. More recently, the user explicitly requested a deterministic Treatment Plan & Risk Decision Engine, including a new  with a Simulate mode, rule-driven evaluation from JSON files (thresholds, contraindications, interactions, example cases), and unit tests.
