The previous AI engineer focused on resolving persistent mobile APK issues. Initially, unable to load list errors were misdiagnosed as  problems, then correctly identified as  failures for JSON assets by a troubleshoot agent. After fixing these, a  emerged, pointing to  initialization. This involved multiple  import corrections and testing ChatGPT-suggested  wrappers. Due to environmental limitations, the AI could not execute builds, necessitating extensive user interaction for log collection and manual command execution. Git synchronization proved problematic, leading to manual instruction sets. Most recently, after attempts to disable Hermes (suspected as a cause for  issues), the app is now crashing on startup, shifting the focus to diagnosing this new critical error.

<product_requirements>
The MHT Assessment is an offline-first React Native/Expo mobile application designed for clinical decision support, featuring risk scoring, treatment plans, and a Drug Interaction Checker (DIC). The core problem addressed has been persistent runtime errors, especially concerning , data persistence, and codebase build/sync challenges.

Key requirements and current implementation status include:
*   **Stability**: Addressed  crashes through , , and later by correcting  import mismatches. JSON asset loading via  calls in APK builds was also fixed with robust error handling. However, new crashes on startup have emerged after attempts to disable Hermes.
*   **Data Persistence**:  access for patient records and guidelines was stabilized, though its reliability continues to be a debugging focus.
*   **Branding**: Custom app icon and an animated splash screen are implemented.
*   **Drug Interaction Checker (DIC)**: Fully functional with 150 combinations, categorized selection, and a medical disclaimer.
*   **Deliverables**: Comprehensive project archives, local setup, APK build instructions, and GitHub synchronization scripts have been provided.
*   **Ongoing Bug Fixes**: The current focus is diagnosing a new app crash on opening, which arose after attempting to disable Hermes to resolve previous  undefined errors.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard Expo project structure, leveraging  for file-based routing.



-   ****: The main entry point for the application.
    -   **Changes**: Debugging logs for  availability were added. A duplicate  import was introduced, causing an  error, which was subsequently fixed.
-   ****: Displays MHT clinical guidelines.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to use  function instead of direct  for JSON assets. Defensive coding with fallbacks for  was added to prevent crashes from undefined data.
-   ****: Manages patient records.
    -   **Changes**: Uses  with . Defensive coding with safe destructuring and fallbacks was added for  from  to handle store initialization issues. Debug logging for  was introduced.
-   ****: Zustand store for application state.
    -   **Changes**:  calls were initially replaced with . Later, modified to use  with a  wrapper, and then adjusted to use direct  to address timing issues. Additional store persistence protection was implemented.
-   ****: Provides error boundaries and safe rendering for lists.
    -   **Changes**: Enhanced error messages, added more robust handling for /  prop with detailed logging. A bug was identified and fixed where it incorrectly called  on the  prop.
-   ****: Wrapper for .
    -   **Changes**: Refactored to use a direct import of  from  and includes an  method.
-   ****: Displays assessment results.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed an incorrect import path for .
-   ****: Implements drug interaction logic.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected an import path for .
-   ****: Utility for drug interaction aggregation.
    -   **Changes**: Updated  to  function for APK compatibility.
-   ****, ****, ****, ****: CME-related screens.
    -   **Changes**: Updated  statements to use  functions with error handling for JSON assets.
-   ****: Safe wrapper for DIC.
    -   **Changes**: Updated  to  function for JSON assets.
-   **** and ****: Utilities for treatment plan data.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected  imports from named  to default .
-   ****: Screen for treatment plans.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected  import from named to default.
-   **** and ****: Temporary files created for debugging purposes.
    -   **Changes**: These were created to test a simplified store and list component, bypassing  persistence to isolate the root cause.
-   ** (PowerShell scripts)**: , , ,  (and their  versions).
    -   **Changes**: These scripts were created and iteratively corrected for PowerShell syntax errors to help the user verify applied fixes, apply missing ones, and automatically disable Hermes on their local PC.

<pending_tasks>
-   Diagnose the new app crash on opening, which occurred after attempts to disable Hermes.
-   Continue troubleshooting persistent  if it recurs.
-   Complete implementation of the Robust, offline-capable Treatment Plan Generator (initially added, then button removed).
-   Address remaining comprehensive product specifications (e.g., Knowledge Hub, encrypted SQLite, E2E tests).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the user reported that the application is now **crashing on opening**. This critical issue emerged after the AI engineer, in an attempt to resolve prior  errors, provided a PowerShell script () to automatically disable Hermes, a suggestion to address potential timing or module loading conflicts specific to the Hermes JavaScript engine.

The AI engineer's last action was to request specific and comprehensive crash logs from the user's mobile device to diagnose the immediate startup crash. The AI provided several  commands targeted at capturing all relevant crash details, including , , and fatal errors (). The AI also offered quick recovery steps, such as reverting Hermes changes (by restoring backup files) and performing a nuclear clean and rebuild of the project. This indicates a shift from debugging list loading failures to a more fundamental app initialization failure.
