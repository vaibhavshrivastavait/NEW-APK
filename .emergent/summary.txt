The AI engineer's work spanned multiple significant feature enhancements and critical bug fixes. Initially, it involved resolving build-time and runtime errors, including dependency mismatches, Metro bundling issues, and , leading to screen refactoring. The  was updated. Subsequently, the focus shifted to implementing comprehensive Android tablet support, creating responsive layouts, and tablet-optimized screens with multi-pane views. The MHT guidelines were then enhanced with a pink color scheme, combining old and new data, and the patient view was improved by redesigning the UI/UX and removing export functionalities. A Saved Patient Records screen was fully implemented with search, filter, and responsive detail views. The most recent efforts involved debugging a  during an Android build and are currently focused on addressing a regression where the old patient record view is still being displayed and an export button reappeared.

<product_requirements>
The MHT Assessment application is an offline-first React Native/Expo mobile app providing clinical decision support, risk scoring, treatment plans, and a Drug Interaction Checker. It requires robust stability, persistent storage (AsyncStorage) for patient records and guidelines, custom branding, and a functional Drug Interaction Checker. Initial development focused on fixing critical crashes (,  errors) by refactoring  and . Recent work included enhancing the patient details view, upgrading the MHT guideline section to world-class standards, and updating drug interaction data. Further requirements included full Android tablet support (responsive layouts, multi-pane views, consistent styling), combining old and new MHT guidelines with a searchable, bookmarkable interface and calming pink theme, and creating a Saved Patient Records screen with search, filter, sort, detailed patient cards, and responsive layouts for both phones and tablets, including explicit removal of export functionalities.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a bug reported by the user. The user stated that the app was still loading the *old* patient record view instead of the newly implemented Saved Patient Records screen, and an export report button was still visible inside the patient view.

The AI engineer's actions focused on diagnosing this issue:
1.  **Investigated **: The AI found that the  variable, which is used in the navigation stack for the PatientList route, was still referencing the old  or .
2.  **Corrected Navigation**: The AI updated  to ensure that the PatientList route now correctly points to the .
3.  **Checked **: The AI verified that the  (the enhanced detailed view) does not contain any explicit export buttons.
4.  **Investigating **: The AI is currently in the process of examining the *old*  file for any remaining export report functionality, which could be the source of the persistent export button reported by the user. This implies that while the  has been cleaned, the legacy  might still be contributing to the UI issue or an outdated version is being rendered somewhere else.

<optional_next_step>
Verify and remove any remaining export report functionality from the old  file.
