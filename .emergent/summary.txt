The trajectory details the AI's extensive efforts to restore and enhance the MHT Assessment Expo app. Initially, the focus was on resolving a persistent  error, particularly in the web preview, traced to components like  and  incompatibility. The AI successfully stabilized the core app by using  as a baseline, then re-integrated features from a GitHub repository, carefully addressing the  error by creating . Significant work was then done on the Drug Interaction Checker (DIC), implementing 150 combinations, category-based selection, multi-selection, automatic checking, custom disclaimers, and UI refinements (layout, spacing, highlighting). Concurrently, the AI debugged web preview failures (including a syntax error with a non-JS multiplication symbol) and fixed local APK build issues related to corrupted image assets by generating new ones. The work concluded with a  in , indicating an  access problem.

<product_requirements>
The MHT Assessment is an offline-first React Native/Expo mobile app for clinical decision support focusing on risk scoring, treatment plans, and a Drug Interaction Checker (DIC). Key requirements are:
1.  **Stability**: Resolve  and   crashes.
2.  **Data Persistence**: Fix   in  and .
3.  **Branding**: Custom app icon, animated splash screen.
4.  **Drug Interaction Checker (DIC)**: Implement multi-selection with grouped, color-coded severity (LOW=Yellow, MODERATE=Orange, HIGH=Red), using  for 1:1 severity mappings. Display 15 dynamic categories and 150 combinations, with optional medicine name, severity, rationale, and mandatory disclaimer. This has been extensively developed to use category-based selection (Recommended Medicine, Optional Medicine), allow multi-selection for optional medicines, automatically check interactions, display a comprehensive disclaimer and severity legend, and feature version 1 in the About section.
5.  **Deliverables**: Provide compressed project archives and clear local setup/APK build instructions (Windows CMD, Linux/macOS bash, no EAS).
6.  **Ongoing Bug Fixes**: Address - Creating native project directories (./ios and ./android) and updating .gitignore
‚úî Created native projects | /android, /ios already created
- Adding Metro bundler config

-   ****: The main entry point for the React Native application. It currently loads .
-   ****: Represents the intended full navigation structure of the application, now successfully loading after previous fixes.
-   ****: A core navigable screen. Its import of  was identified as problematic, and it was updated to use .
-   ****: This component was a primary culprit for the recurring reduce error and was functionally replaced.
-   ****: This is a newly created and heavily modified component. It now implements the core Drug Interaction Checker logic:
    -   Loads 150 drug interaction combinations from .
    -   Presents Recommended Medicine and Optional Medicine categories as vertical lists.
    -   Allows single selection for Recommended Medicine and multiple selections for Optional Medicine.
    -   Automatically triggers interaction checking upon selection, displaying results in a list format.
    -   Includes a comprehensive medical disclaimer (positioned below the severity legend) and a color-coded severity legend, both conditionally displayed when results are shown.
    -   Uses highlighting for selected medicines and includes updated spacing and UI elements.
-   ****: Contains the core logic for drug interaction calculations. It was modified to add null/undefined checks to array operations to prevent errors.
-   ****: This screen is currently encountering a , indicating an issue with  access.
-   ****: Modified to include an App Version 1 card in its About section.
-   ****: The central data source for drug interaction rules. Its JSON structure was initially malformed but has since been fixed and now contains 150 combinations.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on resolving a critical runtime error reported by the user: TypeError: Cannot read property getItem of undefined, which occurs when navigating to the MHT Guidelines section of the application. This error points to an  access issue within the  component. The AI's last action was to acknowledge this error and state, Let me examine and fix the GuidelinesScreen:. This problem was identified after successfully implementing and refining the Drug Interaction Checker, along with addressing local APK build issues and web preview failures.
