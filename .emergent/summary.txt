The AI engineer's work primarily focused on stabilizing an Expo React Native application inherited from a previous AI. The initial phase involved resolving critical build and runtime issues, which included addressing , Gradle errors, SDK/Node.js mismatches, and persistent . Key actions included updating Babel, Gradle, and Expo SDK dependencies.

A significant portion of the work revolved around a recurring  error in list components. The AI initially recreated  and  to use standard  components, then refined them into crash-proof versions, and eventually replaced  with  and manual rendering to bypass the persistent  issues. Simultaneously, the engineer addressed local environment issues reported by the user, such as  file watcher limits in the container, Node.js version discrepancies, and  errors, though the container preview issues remained unresolved. Later, the engineer implemented defensive checks for data validation and fixed an invalid icon warning. Towards the end, the engineer enhanced the patient details view, upgraded the MHT guidelines section to a world-class standard, and updated the  file. The trajectory concludes with the AI working on the  file.

<product_requirements>
The MHT Assessment application is an offline-first React Native/Expo mobile app designed to offer clinical decision support, risk scoring, treatment plans, and a Drug Interaction Checker. Its core requirements include robust stability, persistent storage of patient records and guidelines via , custom branding, and a fully functional Drug Interaction Checker capable of handling numerous combinations. Key deliverables encompass project archives, local setup instructions, APK build guides, and GitHub synchronization.

The immediate problem addressed was persistent app crashes () and  errors, specifically affecting list components after a failed attempt to disable Hermes. This necessitated a complete recreation and refactoring of problematic screens (, ). Recent updates focused on enhancing the patient records view to display comprehensive assessment details and transforming the MHT guideline section into a professional, evidence-based reference comparable to leading medical apps, alongside updating drug interaction data.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on updating the  file. The user requested to add breast cancer as an optional medicine. The AI found that breast cancer was already present but had formatting issues and outdated metadata. The AI proceeded to fix these JSON formatting inconsistencies within  (Chat Message 426-431). The AI has completed formatting fixes for several breast cancer entries in the  file. The next step identified by the AI is to copy this updated  file from  to  to ensure consistency across the project. This action ensures that the drug interaction data used by the application, whether during development or in a build, is up-to-date and correctly formatted. This is the last task the AI was working on.
