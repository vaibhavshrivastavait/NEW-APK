<analysis>
The trajectory details the work of an AI engineer on an Expo React Native application. Initially, the engineer focused on resolving critical build and runtime issues, including , Gradle , SDK/Node.js mismatches, and  in . Solutions involved Babel configuration, Gradle property adjustments, dependency alignment (Expo SDK 50), and iterative fixes to .

Subsequently, the engineer, as tasked, recreated the  and  from scratch to eliminate deep-seated issues related to  and leverage modern React Native patterns. This process involved extensive debugging of Expo startup problems (Metro bundler conflicts,  incompatibility, port conflicts, file watcher limits), often requiring intervention from a , npm <command>

Usage:

npm install        install all the dependencies in your project
npm install <foo>  add the <foo> dependency to your project
npm test           run this project's tests
npm run <foo>      run the script named <foo>
npm <command> -h   quick help on <command>
npm -l             display usage info for all commands
npm help <term>    search for help on <term>
npm help npm       more involved overview

<product_requirements>
The MHT Assessment is an offline-first React Native/Expo mobile application providing clinical decision support, risk scoring, treatment plans, and a Drug Interaction Checker (DIC). It requires stability,  for patient records and guidelines, custom branding (icon, animated splash), and a functional DIC (150 combinations, categorized selection, disclaimer). Deliverables include project archives, local setup, APK build instructions, and GitHub synchronization. The immediate problem being addressed was persistent app crashes () and  errors after an attempt to disable Hermes, specifically affecting list components and requiring screen recreations.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React Native/Expo (SDK 50)**: Cross-platform mobile development, utilizing  for file-based routing.
-   **Zustand & AsyncStorage**: State management for offline data persistence of assessments.
-   **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and improves code maintainability.
-   **Error Boundaries**: Implemented in components like  and  for UI stability.
-   **Android Gradle Build System**: Used for generating native APKs and managing dependencies.
-   **Hermes**: JavaScript engine, initially a source of runtime issues requiring careful management.
-   **Metro Bundler**: Essential for bundling React Native applications.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully recreated both the  and  from scratch, resolving persistent issues related to  and ensuring the app loads and functions correctly in the Emergent preview. The  was updated to use a standard  and preserve existing features like search, bookmarks, and offline mode. The  was also rebuilt to incorporate modern React patterns, remove , and maintain core CRUD functionalities with enhancements like multi-field search and improved empty states.

Following these successes, the user requested steps to run the app locally and build an APK. The AI provided a comprehensive local setup guide. The current work involves synchronizing the project's git repository. The AI has checked the git status and confirmed remote repositories are configured. It is currently in the process of committing the recent changes, specifically focusing on the recreated screen files ( and ), while attempting to exclude changes related to .
