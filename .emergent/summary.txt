The previous AI engineer systematically addressed a series of critical build and runtime issues in an Expo React Native application. The process began with diagnosing a startup crash () after an attempt to disable Hermes, which was traced to modern JavaScript syntax not being transpiled. Initial fixes involved adjusting Babel configuration and , but persistent crashes led to a strategy of directly replacing problematic optional chaining () and nullish coalescing () syntax with compatible alternatives. This, however, introduced new build failures related to malformed code and persistent cache issues, necessitating aggressive cache clearing and repeated user rebuilds.

Further debugging revealed Gradle build failures, specifically  for  and subsequently , indicating Expo SDK version mismatches (SDK 54 vs. expected 49-50) and Node.js compatibility problems (v20+). The AI then focused on aligning dependencies and preparing a stable environment for the user to clone. Finally, a runtime error () emerged in , prompting multiple fixes to that component, including replacing it with a standard  in one screen. The conversation concluded with a proposal to recreate core screens to resolve deep-seated issues, with a focus on retaining all existing functionality and data.

<product_requirements>
The MHT Assessment is an offline-first React Native/Expo mobile application providing clinical decision support, including risk scoring, treatment plans, and a Drug Interaction Checker (DIC). The core problem has been persistent runtime errors, data persistence challenges, and codebase build/sync issues. The application needs to be stable, with  access for patient records and guidelines, custom branding (icon, animated splash screen), and a functional DIC (150 combinations, categorized selection, disclaimer). Comprehensive project archives, local setup, APK build instructions, and GitHub synchronization scripts are deliverables. The ongoing focus is diagnosing and resolving a critical app crash on opening that arose after attempts to disable Hermes, and addressing  issues.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a persistent runtime error in the  component on the , specifically . This error indicated that the  property, typically associated with , was being erroneously accessed or expected within the  (which wraps a ).

Despite multiple attempts to fix  by adding default props, improving error handling with  blocks, and filtering out custom props, the error persisted. This led the AI to temporarily replace the custom  component with a standard  in  to isolate the problem.

Following this, the user suggested recreating the  and  screens from scratch, remembering the errors faced. The AI confirmed that this approach could potentially resolve accumulated issues by rebuilding with clean, modern React Native patterns while preserving all existing functionality and data. The last communication was the AI confirming that the recreation would maintain current functionality and MHT guidelines details.
