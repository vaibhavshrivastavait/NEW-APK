# 🔧 Tar Extraction Error - FIXED & Working Solution

## ❌ Problem Identified & Solved

**Root Cause**: The original tar.gz file contained extremely long file paths in node_modules (jsc-android package) that exceeded system limits, causing extraction failures even in Git Bash.

**Error You Encountered**:
```
tar: mht-assessment-complete-20250912-140207/node_modules/jsc-android/dist/org/webkit/android-jsc-intl/r250231/android-jsc-intl-r250231.pom.md5: Cannot open: No such file or directory
```

## ✅ SOLUTION: Clean Build Package Created

I've created a **clean, working package** that eliminates all problematic files.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting (Unlikely with Clean Package)

### If npm install fails:
```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### If Gradle build fails:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### If extraction still fails (very unlikely):
```bash
# Use shorter path
cd /c/
mkdir MHT
cd MHT
tar -xzf /path/to/mht-assessment-clean-build.tar.gz
```
