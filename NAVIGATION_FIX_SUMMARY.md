# ✅ MHT Assessment - Navigation Issue FIXED

## 🚨 Critical Issue Identified and Resolved

### Problem Found
The original ZIP package contained a **critical navigation configuration issue** that caused the app to display properly but not respond to touch interactions.

### Root Cause
- **Entry Point Issue**: `index.js` was importing `App.tsx` (a static UI component with no navigation)
- **Missing Navigation**: The static component had TouchableOpacity elements but no onPress handlers
- **Result**: App displayed correctly but buttons/cards didn't work when tapped

### ✅ Fix Applied
- **Updated Entry Point**: Changed `index.js` to import `AppWithNavigation.tsx`
- **Added Navigation**: Complete NavigationContainer with Stack Navigator
- **Working Handlers**: All onPress handlers properly configured
- **Screen Routing**: Full navigation between all app screens

## 📦 New Fixed Package

**Download**: `MHT_Assessment_NAVIGATION_FIXED.zip` (26MB)
**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR BUILD AND DEPLOYMENT**
