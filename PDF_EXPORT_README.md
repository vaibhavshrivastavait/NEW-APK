## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **PDF Generation Fails**: Check data completeness and available storage
2. **Share Dialog Doesn't Appear**: Verify device has sharing apps installed
3. **PDF Appears Blank**: Ensure all CSS styles are properly inline
4. **File Not Found**: Check file permissions and storage access

### Debug Information
- Enable console logging in `pdfExportGenerator.ts`
- Check expo-print library compatibility
- Verify HTML template renders correctly
- Test with minimal data set first

## Security and Privacy

### Data Handling

- No patient data transmitted to external servers
- Files stored in app-specific directories
- Sharing controlled by user through native OS dialogs

### Confidentiality
- All PDFs include confidentiality notices
- Files are not automatically uploaded to cloud services
- User controls all sharing and storage decisions
- Follows medical data privacy best practices

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- HTML template is optimized for fast rendering
- Images are compressed and optimized
- CSS is inline to avoid external dependencies
- Large datasets are paginated appropriately

### Resource Usage
- Typical PDF generation takes 2-5 seconds
- Memory usage is optimized for mobile devices
- File sizes are kept under 5MB for sharing compatibility
- Background processing prevents UI blocking
