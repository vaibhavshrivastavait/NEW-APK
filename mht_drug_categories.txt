MAPPING FILE TO UPDATE:
- File: /app/assets/rules/drug_interactions.json
- Current structure: "pairs" array with "main" and "optionals"
- You can add severity levels: "high", "moderate", "low"

TOTAL REALISTIC SCOPE:
- Main categories: ~15 (focused on MHT treatment)
- Optional categories: ~35 (common daily medications for women)
- Realistic interaction pairs: 100-150 (much more manageable)

This focuses on real-world scenarios that women actually encounter during MHT treatment, not theoretical medical combinations.
