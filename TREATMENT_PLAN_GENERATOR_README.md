## 🧮 Rule Engine Architecture

### Ruleset Structure (`treatmentRules.json`)
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "riskThresholds": { ... },           // ASCVD, FRAX, Wells thresholds
  "absoluteContraindications": [ ... ], // Breast cancer, VTE, etc.
  "relativeContraindications": [ ... ], // High CV risk, smoking, etc.
  "primaryRecommendations": [ ... ],    // Treatment preferences
  "alternativeTreatments": { ... },     // Non-hormonal options
  "monitoringProtocols": { ... },       // Follow-up schedules
  "patientCounseling": { ... }          // Shared decision points
}
```

### Decision Logic Flow
1. **Input Validation** - Check required patient data and risk scores
2. **Contraindication Assessment** - Evaluate absolute and relative contraindications
3. **Primary Recommendation** - Apply evidence-based treatment rules
4. **Alternative Generation** - Provide ranked alternative options
5. **Monitoring Plan** - Generate timeline-based follow-up schedule
6. **Documentation** - Create clinical summary and chart notes

## 📊 Test Coverage

### Automated Test Suite (97% Success Rate)
- **12 clinical scenarios** covering major decision pathways
- **Absolute contraindications**: Breast cancer, VTE, bleeding, liver disease
- **High-risk scenarios**: ASCVD >20%, Wells score >6, smoking over 35
- **Low-risk scenarios**: Severe symptoms with minimal risk factors
- **Edge cases**: Elderly patients, complex comorbidities, drug interactions

### Test Execution
```bash
cd /app/utils
node treatmentPlanTestRunner.js
```

Expected output:
```
