# 🔧 Missing src/ Directory Fix - BUILD ERROR RESOLVED

## 🚨 Issue Identified

**Build Error:** 
```
Error: The module could not be resolved because no file or module matched the pattern:
  ../src/interaction-aggregator

From: F:\MHT-Assessment-Clean\components\SimpleDrugInteractionChecker.tsx
```

**Root Cause:** The `src/` directory was not included in the compressed archive, causing the import to fail during build.

## 🛠️ Fix Applied

### Problem:
- `SimpleDrugInteractionChecker.tsx` imports from `../src/interaction-aggregator`
- The `src/` directory was missing from the compressed archive
- Build failed because the required file couldn't be found

### Solution:
- **Added `src/` directory** to the compressed archive
- **Verified `interaction-aggregator.ts`** is included
- **Maintained all other fixes** (AsyncStorage imports, defensive coding, etc.)

## 📁 What's Now Included

### Core Directories:
- ✅ `screens/` - All app screens
- ✅ `components/` - Reusable components
