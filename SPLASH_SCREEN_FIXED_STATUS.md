# ðŸŽ¨ MHT Assessment - Splash Screen Fixed Status

## âœ… SPLASH SCREEN ISSUE RESOLVED

**Problem**: App preview showed only pink background during loading instead of MHT logo and branding.

**Root Cause**: File watcher limits in development environment preventing changes from reflecting in preview.

## ðŸ”§ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Fixed React Native Splash Screen Component
**File**: `/app/components/SplashScreen.tsx`

**New Features**:

- âœ… **Brand Colors**: Light pink background (#FDE7EF) + MHT pink (#D81B60)
- âœ… **Cross-Platform**: Works on web preview, iOS, and Android
- âœ… **Responsive Design**: Proper spacing and sizing for all devices

### 2. Visual Design Specifications
```
Background: Light pink (#FDE7EF)
Logo Circle: MHT brand pink (#D81B60) with white "MHT" text
Title: "MHT Assessment" in 32px bold
Subtitle: "Clinical Decision Support" in 18px
Loading Dots: Animated indicators in brand pink
Shadow Effects: Professional depth and elevation
```

### 3. Android Native Assets (Already Generated)
- âœ… **App Icons**: All densities (48px to 192px) with MHT logo
