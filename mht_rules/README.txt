MHT Rules Bundle
----------------
Files:
- risk_thresholds.json
- drug_interactions.json
- treatment_rules.json
- examples.json
- decision_engine.js
- run_tests.js

How to use:
1. Copy the JSON files into your repo (see integration instructions).
2. Run unit tests locally (node run_tests.js) to confirm behavior.
3. Integrate logic into React Native by porting evaluate() or requiring these files in a Node environment.

NOTE: This is a deterministic rules skeleton for testing & integration. Clinical validation required.
