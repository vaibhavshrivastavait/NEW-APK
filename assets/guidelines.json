2\n- ❌ **NO:** Absolute contraindications present → Non-hormonal alternatives\n\n### Step 2: Uterus Status\n**Does patient have uterus?**\n- ✅ **YES (Uterus intact):** EPT required (estrogen + progestogen) → Step 3\n- ❌ **NO (Hysterectomy):** ET suitable (estrogen only) → Step 4\n\n### Step 3: EPT Route Selection\n**Assess VTE/CVD Risk:**\n- 🔴 **HIGH RISK:** Transdermal EPT or vaginal therapy only\n- 🟡 **MODERATE RISK:** Prefer transdermal EPT\n- 🟢 **LOW RISK:** Oral or transdermal EPT acceptable\n\n### Step 4: ET Route Selection  \n**Assess VTE/CVD Risk:**\n- 🔴 **HIGH RISK:** Transdermal ET or vaginal therapy only\n- 🟡 **MODERATE RISK:** Prefer transdermal ET\n- 🟢 **LOW RISK:** Oral or transdermal ET acceptable\n\n### Step 5: Symptom-Specific Considerations\n**Primary symptom pattern:**\n- **Vasomotor dominant:** Systemic MHT (as above)\n- **GU symptoms dominant:** Consider vaginal therapy first\n- **Both equally:** Systemic + vaginal if needed\n\n## Risk Assessment Quick Reference\n\n### VTE Risk Factors (Choose Route)\n**HIGH RISK (Transdermal/Vaginal only):**\n- Previous VTE (any time)\n- Known thrombophilia\n- Active cancer\n- Immobilization\n\n**MODERATE RISK (Prefer Transdermal):**\n- BMI ≥30\n- Current smoking\n- Age >60 years\n- Family history VTE\n\n**LOW RISK (Oral Acceptable):**\n- BMI <30\n- Non-smoker\n- Age <60 years\n- No VTE history/family history\n\n### CVD Risk Factors (Choose Route)\n**HIGH RISK (Transdermal/Vaginal only):**\n- Established CVD\n- Diabetes with complications\n- Multiple risk factors\n\n**MODERATE RISK (Prefer Transdermal):**\n- Hypertension\n- Diabetes without complications  \n- High cholesterol\n- Smoking\n\n**LOW RISK (Oral Acceptable):**\n- No CVD risk factors\n- Well-controlled single risk factor\n\n## Dosing Quick Reference\n\n### Standard Starting Doses\n**Oral Preparations:**\n- Estradiol: 1mg daily\n- Conjugated estrogens: 0.625mg daily\n- + Micronized progesterone: 100mg daily\n\n**Transdermal Preparations:**\n- Estradiol patches: 25-50mcg twice weekly\n- Estradiol gel: 0.5-1mg daily\n- + Micronized progesterone: 100mg daily\n\n**Vaginal Preparations:**\n- Estradiol tablets: 10mcg daily x 2 weeks, then 2x weekly\n- Estriol cream: 0.5mg daily x 2-3 weeks, then 2x weekly\n\n### Dose Adjustments\n**Increase Dose If (after 3 months):**\n- Persistent vasomotor symptoms\n- Inadequate symptom relief\n- Good tolerability\n\n**Decrease Dose If:**\n- Side effects (breast tenderness, bloating)\n- Breakthrough bleeding persistent\n- Patient preference for lower dose\n\n## Contraindication Checklist\n\n### Absolute Contraindications ❌\n- [ ] Current/past breast cancer\n- [ ] Current/past endometrial cancer  \n- [ ] Active liver disease\n- [ ] Unexplained vaginal bleeding\n- [ ] Active VTE\n- [ ] Known high-risk thrombophilia\n- [ ] Acute MI or stroke\n\n### Relative Contraindications ⚠️\n- [ ] Remote history VTE\n- [ ] High CVD risk\n- [ ] Migraine with aura  \n- [ ] Gallbladder disease\n- [ ] Severe liver disease (past)\n- [ ] Large fibroids\n\n## Follow-up Schedule\n\n### Timeline Checklist\n- **1 Month:** ✅ Tolerability, side effects, BP\n- **3 Months:** ✅ Symptom control, bleeding pattern\n- **6 Months:** ✅ Safety review, examination\n- **12 Months:** ✅ Annual risk-benefit assessment\n- **Annually:** ✅ Ongoing monitoring\n\n### What to Assess\n- **Efficacy:** Symptom improvement, QoL\n- **Safety:** BP, weight, breast exam\n- **Adherence:** Compliance, tolerability\n- **Risks:** New risk factors, family history\n- **Satisfaction:** Patient preference, concerns\n\n## Emergency Action Cards\n\n### 🚨 STOP MHT IMMEDIATELY if:\n- Suspected VTE (leg swelling, chest pain + SOB)\n- Suspected stroke (sudden neurological symptoms)\n- Suspected MI (chest pain with cardiac features)\n- New breast cancer diagnosis\n- Severe liver dysfunction\n\n### ⚠️ URGENT ASSESSMENT if:\n- New breast lump\n- Unexpected heavy bleeding  \n- Severe persistent headache\n- Abdominal pain + jaundice\n- New neurological symptoms\n\n### 📞 ROUTINE REVIEW if:\n- Persistent side effects\n- Inadequate symptom control\n- Patient concerns about continuation\n- New medications started\n- Lifestyle changes affecting risk\n\n## Treatment Algorithms\n\n### Algorithm 1: First-Time MHT User\n1. **Assess contraindications** → Absolute = Stop, Relative = Specialist\n2. **Uterus present?** → Yes = EPT, No = ET  \n3. **Risk assessment** → High/Moderate = Transdermal, Low = Oral OK\n4. **Start standard dose** → Review at 1 month\n5. **Optimize at 3 months** → Adjust dose/route if needed\n\n### Algorithm 2: MHT Side Effects\n1. **Identify side effect** → Bleeding, breast pain, nausea, headache\n2. **Timing assessment** → Early (<3 months) vs Late (>3 months)\n3. **Severity assessment** → Mild = Reassure, Severe = Modify\n4. **Modification options** → Dose, route, preparation, timing\n5. **Review response** → Continue, switch, or stop\n\n### Algorithm 3: Stopping MHT\n1. **Indication to stop** → Contraindication, choice, age-related\n2. **Stopping method** → Gradual vs abrupt\n3. **Symptom monitoring** → Expect return in 50-80%\n4. **Management options** → Restart, alternatives, lifestyle\n5. **Long-term plan** → Bone health, CVD prevention",
