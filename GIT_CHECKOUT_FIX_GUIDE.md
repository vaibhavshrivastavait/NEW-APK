```

### Extract & Build (No npm install needed)

# Extract the complete package
tar -xzf mht-assessment-complete-20250912-140207.tar.gz

```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Windows Git Issues

### If You Still Get Checkout Errors:

#### 1. Enable Long Path Support
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
git config --system core.longpaths true
```

#### 2. Configure Git for Windows
```powershell
git config --global core.autocrlf true
git config --global core.safecrlf false
git config --global core.precomposeUnicode true
```

#### 3. Use Git Bash Instead of PowerShell
```bash
# Open Git Bash and try:
git clone https://github.com/vaibhavshrivastavait/MHT-FINAL.git
```

## ✅ Verification Steps

After successful clone, verify these files exist:

Test-Path "package.json"      # Should return True
Test-Path "android\build.gradle"  # Should return True
Test-Path "components\"       # Should return True
Test-Path "screens\"          # Should return True

# Check project size (should be ~50-60MB without node_modules)
Get-ChildItem | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum
```
