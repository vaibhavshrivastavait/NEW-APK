# 🔧 Path Resolution Issue - COMPLETELY FIXED

## ❌ Your Original Error (RESOLVED)
```
Failed to apply plugin 'com.facebook.react.rootproject'.
C:\Users\shriv\MHT\mht-assessment-fixed-build\android\node_modules\react-native\ReactAndroid\gradle.properties (The system cannot find the path specified)
```

## ✅ ROOT CAUSE & SOLUTION

### Problem Identified:
- **Gradle was looking for `node_modules` in the wrong location**
- **Expected**: `C:\Users\shriv\MHT\mht-assessment-fixed-build\node_modules\`
- **But searched**: `C:\Users\shriv\MHT\mht-assessment-fixed-build\android\node_modules\`

### Solution Applied:
- **Updated all Gradle files** to use `rootDir.parentFile` instead of `rootDir`
- **Fixed path resolution** in `build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`, and `app/build.gradle`
- **Corrected React Native plugin paths** to look in the correct directory
