# GitHub Sync - Direct Commands

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION (Copy & Paste)

Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials and run these commands:

```bash
# Set your GitHub credentials (REPLACE WITH YOUR ACTUAL VALUES)
export GITHUB_USERNAME="your_actual_username"
export GITHUB_EMAIL="your_actual_email@example.com"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_actual_personal_access_token"
export GITHUB_REPO="your_existing_repository_name"
export GITHUB_FULLNAME="Your Actual Full Name"

# THE KEY: Skip repository creation entirely
export SKIP_REPO_CREATION="true"

# Run the sync
./secure-github-sync.sh
```

## WHY THIS WORKS

The `SKIP_REPO_CREATION="true"` flag tells the script to:
- ✅ Skip all repository detection logic
- ✅ Skip all repository creation attempts  
- ✅ Go directly to the Git setup and push process
- ✅ Avoid the "name already exists" error completely

## VERIFICATION

After running the commands, you should see:
```
✅ Skipping repository creation as requested
✅ Assuming repository exists: username/repo-name
```

Instead of any repository creation attempts.

## IF YOU STILL GET THE ERROR

It means the `SKIP_REPO_CREATION` environment variable isn't being set properly. Try:

```bash
# Verify the variable is set
echo "SKIP_REPO_CREATION is: $SKIP_REPO_CREATION"

# If it shows empty, set it explicitly
SKIP_REPO_CREATION="true" ./secure-github-sync.sh
```
