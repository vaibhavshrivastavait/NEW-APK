---

## 🛠️ Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Emergent's Native GitHub Integration (Recommended)

Since you're in the Emergent environment, the easiest way is to use the platform's built-in GitHub integration:

1. **Look for "Save to GitHub" button** in the Emergent interface
2. **Click it** and select your MHT-FINAL repository
3. **Push the changes** - this will update the repository with the fix

### Option 2: Personal Access Token Authentication

If you want to use the command line:

1. **Create a Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
   - Copy the token

2. **Push with token**:
   ```bash
   cd /app
   git push https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/vaibhavshrivastavait/MHT-FINAL.git main
   ```

### Option 3: Manual Repository Update

If authentication is difficult, you can manually update the repository:

1. **Download the fixed files** from this environment
2. **Clone the repository locally on your PC**
3. **Replace the files** and commit
4. **Push from your PC** where you have GitHub authentication set up
