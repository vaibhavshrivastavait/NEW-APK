# MHT Assessment - Sync and Build Commands

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository (e.g., `mht-assessment`)
2. Copy the repository URL

### Step 2: Sync Code from Emergent to GitHub
```bash
# Replace YOUR_GITHUB_URL with your actual repository URL
./scripts/sync-to-github.sh -r https://github.com/yourusername/mht-assessment.git
```

### Step 3: On Your Local Windows PC

#### Option A: Complete Setup (First Time)
```powershell
# Run this as Administrator to install everything
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows-complete-environment-setup.ps1 -AutoInstall -Detailed

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mht-assessment.git
cd mht-assessment

# Build APK (dependencies already installed!)
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

#### Option B: Quick Build (If Environment Ready)
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mht-assessment.git
cd mht-assessment

# Build APK directly (npm install already done!)
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug    # For debug APK
./gradlew assembleRelease  # For production APK
```

### Step 4: Install APK
```bash
# Find your APK at:
# Debug: android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
# Release: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

# Install on device via ADB (if connected):
adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```
