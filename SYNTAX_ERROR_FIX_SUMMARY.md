# Syntax Error Fix Summary

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**
The build was failing with a SyntaxError in `SavedPatientRecordsScreen.tsx` at line 810:

```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token, expected "}" (810:11)
  808 |         {renderSortModal()}
  809 | const styles = StyleSheet.create({
> 810 |   container: {
```

## ✅ **Root Cause**
The main React component function was missing proper closing braces and parentheses before the styles definition. The `return` statement and component function were not properly closed.

## 🔧 **Fix Applied**
Added the missing closing syntax:
```typescript
// Before (causing error):
        {/* Sort Modal */}
        {renderSortModal()}
const styles = StyleSheet.create({

// After (fixed):
        {/* Sort Modal */}
        {renderSortModal()}
      </SafeAreaView>
    </KeyboardAvoidingView>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
```

## ✅ **Validation Results**
- ✅ SavedPatientRecordsScreen.tsx syntax validated
- ✅ SavedPatientDetailsScreen.tsx syntax validated  
- ✅ App.tsx syntax validated
- ✅ Expo service restarted successfully
- ✅ All TypeScript parsing successful

## 📱 **Build Readiness**
